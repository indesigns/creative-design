<p><strong>Adaptive Design Definition</strong>, In their recent publication with the emphasis of the feature of by design adaptations only rather than ad hoc adaptations the PhRMA Working Group on Adaptive Design refers to an adaptive design as a clinical trial design that uses accumulating data to decide on how to modify aspects of the study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. In a more technical definition websites built with adaptive design include the CSS media queries of responsive design but they also add JavaScript-based enhancements to change the sites HTML markup based on the devices.
