ANTI_FASHION PROJECT - impulsed by the Manifesto published by Lidewij Edelkoort in 2015 - is the meeting point of those who are now reinventing the system to make it conscious positive and humane. Gill suggests the fashion style of deconstruction called Le Destroy by the French is an intentional effort at unfinished forms that are coming apart recycled or transparent.
