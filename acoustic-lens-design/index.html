<p>The transducer-lens system is one major component in the perform ance of an acoustic microscope. This allows for thinner lenses that can achieve the same focal distance with less impedance mismatch and fewer materials1012 Here a hyperbolic secant distribution is imposed because it produces lenses free of aberrations. A novel acoustic lens design applicable to EM lithotripters has been developed as a means to simultaneously increase bubble activity in the focal region through reduction of secondary compression while broadening the.
