<p>Further advantages of a truss bridge are listed below. Compared to other bridge designs truss bridge designs often require fewer materials to complete the structure. Another advantage of using trusses as the foundation of bridge design is that engineers can place the deck on top of the structure instead of incorporating the roadway within it. This makes it possible to save on design and implementation costs while also reducing the labor needs of the structure.
