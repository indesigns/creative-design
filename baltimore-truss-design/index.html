<p>In the Howe truss design the longer diagonal members are in compression while the shorter vertical members are in tension. The Baltimore truss is a subclass of the Pratt truss. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. The Baltimore truss is a sub-type of the Pratt truss but differs by the addition of half-length struts or ties in the top bottom or both parts of the panels.</p>

<p>A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. In design theory the individual members of a simple truss are only subject to tension pulling and compression pushing forces and not bending forces. Both bridges spanned 785 cm. It has a wide range of applications including being used as a wood truss calculator roof truss calculator roof rafter calculator scissor truss calculator or roof framing. Timothy Palmer 1751-1821 Louis Wernwag 1770-1843 and Theodore Burr 1771-1822.</p>
