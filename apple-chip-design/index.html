<p><strong>Apple Chip Design</strong>, A system on a chip or SoC for short. Apple has already used its Arm-based chip design to power its iPhones and iPads but the move to M1 processors for its Macs completely eliminates its dependency on Intel. By having its own silicon platform for Mac Apple should be able to reduce the risk of being tied to Intels processor plans and its fabrication schedule said Wayne Lam senior director of research at CCS Insight.
