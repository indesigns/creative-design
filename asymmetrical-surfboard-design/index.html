Tim Bessell of Bessell Surfboards is a big believer in asymmetrical designs. In 1965 Carl applied for a patent over his asymmetrical design and in 1967 he received Patent number US3337886 A for an asymmetrical surfboard which according to the US Patent Office compensates for the offset weight distribution of a rider in normal stance and gives the board substantially equal turning ability in either direction.
