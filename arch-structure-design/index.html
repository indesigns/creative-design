<p>Relieving arch is constructed above flat arch or on a wooden lintel to provide greater strength. In case of relieving arch we can replace the decayed wooden lintel easily without disturbing the stability of structure. This building has a steel-frame structure. They are self-supporting stabilised by the force of gravity acting on their weight to hold them in compression.

The techniques involved in designing and constructing arches have since developed into many other structural forms including vaults arcades and bridges. Arches are important structural elements in engineering that provide economical solutions in buildings and bridges. An arch is a structural member curved in a vertical plane and the loads on the arch are carried by the arch ribs mainly through direct axial thrusts the bending moments and shear forces being small compared to a girder which requires larger section to withstand larger bending moments and shear forces caused by the same loading.

<p>An arch is a structural member curved in a vertical plane and the loads on the arch are carried by the arch ribs mainly through direct axial thrusts the bending moments and shear forces being small compared to a girder which requires larger section to withstand larger bending moments and shear forces caused by the same loading. An arch is a structural member curved in a vertical plane and the loads on the arch are carried by the arch ribs mainly through direct axial thrusts the bending moments and shear forces being small compared to a girder which requires larger section to withstand larger bending moments and shear forces caused by the same loading. This arch was designed by engineer Marc Brunel who is also credited with being the first to use reinforced brick masonry. Structure arch is an international icon as was the old stadium with its twin towers which was built in 1923.
