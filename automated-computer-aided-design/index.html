<p>Computer aided design is an activity where design engineers draughtsmen and drawing assistants use specialized interactive computer systems as their assisting instruments in order to formulate and solve technical design problems and to communicate the resulting problem solutions. CAD is software specifically created to help draft documentation visualize 2D or 3D design concepts using photorealistic renderings simulate real-world functionality and export CAD data to computer-aided manufacturing CAM software. CAD centralizes product design into an automated 3D environment. Computer Aided Design CAD is the use of computer software to facilitate the generation modification and optimization of a part or a compilation of parts. Working in CAD Software.</p>
