<p>Impact of AI on Interaction Design Practices in 2020. This way of thinking will allow us to design solutions that are far more powerful than anything that can be achieved by artiﬁcial intelligence alone. Starting from when a user is initially introduced to. Because AI systems are probabilistic and prone to errors they change over time as they learn and as the models get better or evolve and as a result they can violate established principles of traditional interaction design. Designing AI products require a holistic approach including consideration of data models systems and UX.</p>
