<p>Start your review of Applying Domain Driven Design with CQRS and Event Sourcing. Dec 9 2021 Dec 10 2021 200 PM 1400 200 PM. Greg Young described and named the pattern thoroughly in 2010 but the idea existed way before that time. We can design read APIs when we need to access application data as single responsibility and write APIs when we need to update the application data. Make the most of the time you have with the Domain Experts with a technique called EventStorming.</p>

<p>This means that while the concepts will be explained Greg Young will make you sure you focus on creating working code. Using CQRS can and will offer the right project some considerable advantages. With CQRS we can separate these and make the states of the application more maintainable. As it was mentioned by Udi CQRS is a pattern that should be used where data changes are competitive or collaborativeA lot of systems dont fall in to this category even if they do you would only use CQRS potentially with Event Sourcing CQRS Event Sourcing for a part of the application and not everywhereThis means you cant have automatic audit for your entire system by using CQRS.
