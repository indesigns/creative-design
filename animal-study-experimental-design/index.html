Initial Steps Literature Search A thorough search of the scientific literature must be per-formed to determine what is known about the focus of the study. Improving study designs is one important step towards better reproducible experiments in animal-based research. Randomly assigning animals to experimental groups is necessary to prevent bias that can arise when experimenters or pet owners are permitted to choose the treatment for each animal.

<p>Research on living animals is carried out when it will reveal information which cannot be obtained in other ways. The aim of this review is to provide to new investigators an overview of the important steps involved in experimental designs and also to suggest some practical information that is commonly associated with this process. Guidelines for experimental design and statistical analyses in animal studies submitted for publication in the Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences S. In our study we evaluated the methodological quality of animal research in critical care journals in 2005 and 2015 and found a significant increase in the reporting of power analyses randomization and sample.
