This was said after an explosion destroyed crucial components aboard the spacecraft. 6 Design Brief Apollo 13 Introduction Houston weve had a problem was the first indication that the Apollo 13 mission was in danger. The scenes depicting weightlessness while Apollo 13 is in space were filmed as a combination of practical special effects - with the actors undulating their bodies while sitting on a sprung platform - and onboard the Vomit Comet NASAs plane which could create a brief period of weightlessness by diving steeply. Apollo 13 April 11 17 1970 was the seventh crewed mission in the Apollo space program and the third meant to land on the MoonThe craft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 11 1970 but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the service module SM failed two days into the mission.</p>
