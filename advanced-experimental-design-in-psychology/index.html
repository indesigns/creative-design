Advanced Experimental Design Advanced statistical methods in Experimental Design including specialty ANOVA designs and designing of experimental studies. Only a small fraction of the myriad statistical analytic methods are covered in this book but my rough guess is that these methods cover 60-80 of what you will read in the literature and what is needed for analysis of your own experiments. In previous chapters we have discussed the basic principles of good experimental design.</p>
