<p><strong>Active Building Design</strong>, Active solar design uses outside energy and equipmentlike electricity and solar panelsto help capture and utilize the energy of the sun. With passive design building features such as orientation thermal mass insulation and glazing work together to take advantage of natural sources of heating and cooling such as sun and breezes and to minimise unwanted heat gain and loss.
