<p>Learn about human-centered design in this introductory course from Acumen and IDEO. Human-centered design HCD is a creative approach to problem-solving pioneered by the design firm IDEO. Our team at Abovegroup immersed ourselves in a nine week IDEO and Acumen course testing out this design thinking process on challenges in Trinidads contextIn turn we workshopped the methodology with a group of students at Artisans for Change. Over the duration of the seven-week course participants collaborate in design teams to complete online and offline coursework and are then encouraged to apply human-centered design to design challenges of their own.
