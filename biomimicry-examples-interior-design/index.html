<p><strong>Biomimicry Examples Interior Design</strong>, Theres still room for innovation within biomimicry too. The Humpback whale for example uses bumpy tubercle fins for propulsion which seems rather counterintuitive. Another great example is Leonardo Da Vincis interest in flight through the study of bird wings see figure 3. Benyus 1997 divides solution-driven and problem- driven approaches into three levels of mimicry namely Form Organism Process Behaviour and Eco-system.</p>

This article explores the ways in which biomimicry techniques based on the Design Spiral and Janine Benyus Biomimicry Design Lens Principles of Life can be combined with the design process of an interior design thereby to create a framework with the help of which a designer works and creates a sustainable interior design. 10 thoughts on 17 Examples Of Biomimicry Designs That Copy The Genius Of Nature. Oakey posits that the next frontier in biomimetic carpet design will be 3-D printing which will allow designers to create carpet tiles at the site echoing natures way of existing in a local context.</p>
