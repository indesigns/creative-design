<p>Frame- It is a steel plate that runs longitudinally or transversely throughout the hull structure. The first one is the Basic Design with aim to create a baseline concept of the new vessel that satisfi es the shipowners requirements. The deep-V hull was developed in the late 1950s and proved to be optimal for high-speed offshore vessels with transom deadrise of 18 to 24 degrees. The Norway class is the most recent triangular design and every aspect of the ship is designed around this principle to take the most advantage of it.</p>
