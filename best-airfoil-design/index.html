<p>In Martin Hepperles JavaFoil you work with a single virtual working airfoil. Many of these would require working on a conceptual or preliminary sizing task where you would design a planform twist dihedral tail volume CG mass estimation aeroelasticity computations etc. If the plane is to be a precision aerobat then a symmetrical airfoil is most appropriate because it flies the same in. This process of fixing the most obvious problems with a given airfoil is repeated until there is no major problem with the section.</p>
