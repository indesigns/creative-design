<p>It is optimized to operate in deep continuous conduction mode eliminating the need for output electrolytic capacitors. In order to reduce the cost and volume of small-medium power ac-dc light-emitting diode LED lighting systems single-stage LED drivers are often used to drive LEDs with constant current. In this paper a single-stage isolated high-power factor ac-dc LED driver is proposed and analyzed in detail which is composed of a buck-boost power factor correction unit operating in.
