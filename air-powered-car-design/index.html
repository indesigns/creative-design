<p>It is a real breath of fresh air in cities and the prelude to travel without pollution. In case of our engineering project Baloon-Powered Car the action is air rushing from the straw and pushing against the air behind the car while the reaction is air rushed behind the car through the straw pushing against the car with the same force causing the car in motion towards forward movement.
