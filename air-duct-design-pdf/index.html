This reduction also improves the air flow characteristics at the branch ducts that are closest to the air-handling unitThe 50 rule is demonstrated in Figure 5 on the next pageNote that at the start of the plenum there is an available air volume of 1200 cfm and an available velocity of 900 ftmin. Low-velocity ductwork design is very important for energy efficiency in air distribution systems. Section on return-air systems including a compar- ison guide on the advantages and disadvantages of central and individual returns the use of structural spaces for return-air passages in place of ductwork and design tips for improving sound attenuation.</p>
