<p>Temporary structures construction loads I believe Temporary Structure Design is truly the most important topic for construction engineers. Therefore it is imperative that each ALTRIX roof and supporting structure is designed and certified by an appropriately qualified temporary works scaffold design engineer. It may stand on the ground or on top of a building or be an extension of a scaffold around a building. This new height safety anchor point design incorporates the same stand out features of all our height safety anchors maximising energy absorption.</p>

<p>Design Actions on Structures - Snow EN 1991-1-3 Actions on Structures - Wind EN 1991-1-4 Temporay Demountable Structures Assumptions The design is to account for snow lying on the roof It is assumed that the roof beams will be fixed to the scaffold structure at each end to allow for simply supported design. This new height safety anchor point design incorporates the same stand out features of all our height safety anchors maximising energy absorption. Design Scaffolding offer a first class service in Temporary Roof Systems that provide a water resistant working space for carrying out roofing works in all types of weather conditions. There are a variety of sheeting options for cladding a temporary roof including tin or zinc roofing sheets often referred to as CI sheets temporary roofing systems such as Haki Ubix etc or shrink wrap sheeting. It may stand on the ground or on top of a building or be an extension of a scaffold around a building.</p>
