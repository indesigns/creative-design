<p>Like an architect they design different types of structures butbecause they do not hold a professional certificationtheir designs must be signed off on by a supervising architect. Architectural design is the process an architect goes through in his or her work in doing the preparatory work for the construction of a building. Architecture design refers to the actual design and layout of spaces. The software that is built for computer-based systems can exhibit one of these many architectural styles.</p>

<p>Throughout history architects have found ways to create functional and practical spaces using any materials that were available. Typical outputs are principles structural specifications processes models and standards. IEEE defines architectural design as the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system. Like an architect they design different types of structures butbecause they do not hold a professional certificationtheir designs must be signed off on by a supervising architect. Architects perform analysis and design to document existing structures gaps and future structures.</p>
