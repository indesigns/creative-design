<p>The ATEX directives are two EU directives describing the minimum safety requirements for workplaces and equipment used in explosive atmospheres. Specifically the ATEX Regulations relate to the following equipment and systems. Laser cut mounting plates. Equipment intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in the United States must have the specific mark of one of the NRTLs recognized to test and certify this type of equipment. If you manufacture any products matching the definitions the ATEX Regulations apply to you.</p>
