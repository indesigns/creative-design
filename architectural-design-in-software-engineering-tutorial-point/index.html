<p>Software Engineering is the application of engineering concepts techniques and methods to the development of mission-critical software systems. There are three different levels of software design. The architecture of a system can be viewed as the overall structure of the system the way in which structure provides conceptual integrity of the system. Software Design refers to the smaller structures and it deals with the internal design of a single software process. Software Engineering Architectural Design Geeksforgeeks.</p>
