<p>I intended to design my homebrew antenna tuner to suit my specific antenna system situation instead of using a more universal design which is a one-size-fits-all device normally intended to be useful in most circumstances but generally only with reasonably well-designed HF antennas. Efficiently design and model towers such as lattice towers and guyed masts as well as equipment like antennas mounts and linear appurtenances with these purpose-built applications. Is the only and exclusive company who designs and manufactures a various type of telecommunication and industrialize equipments such as antennas antenna rotators tower and their related equipments and RF generators etc by our own. The provisions of this Standard provide design criteria to insure sufficient strength and stability to resist the effects of seismic ground motions for self-supporting and guyed antenna supporting structures.
