<p><strong>Agricultural Drainage System Design</strong>, An agricultural drainage system is a system by which water is drained on or in the soil to enhance agricultural production of crops. An agricultural drain is a slotted PVC pipe placed into a trench that is backfilled with rocks or sand. We specialize in surface and sub-surface drainage solutions excavation and restoration. The concept is absolutely automatic.</p>

<p>The purpose of the agi pipe is to drain away any water that is in the ground. Drainage system design and management can impact crop production and have environmental consequences. The three types of land forming are discussed first followed by the design and construction of open drains. It may involve any combination of stormwater control erosion control and watertable control.</p>
