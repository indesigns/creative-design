<p>The block design task. Task cards can be used in many ways and work well for direct instruction independent work guided practice or a paraprofessiona. The homogeneity of each block makes the design a more powerful tool. High AQ scorers performed better than low scorers on the whole task in the block design but performed equivalently on the segmented task as would be predicted in the autism spectrum.</p>

Participants were presented with a modified block design task BDT in both a typical visuo-constructive version that involves reconstructing figures from blocks and a perceptual version in which respondents must rapidly match unfragmented figures with a corresponding fragmented target figure. Statistical analysis becomes easier and more reliable when. In experimental psychology refers to a design which systematically divides participants into homogenous groups blocks.
