<p>Some researchers call this method analytic induction. This discussion of the methodology attempts to present some of the specific tools and experiences used to inform the design of the research and the development. A design is used to structure the research to show how all of the major parts of the research project the samples or groups measures treatments or programs and methods of assignment work together to try to address the central research questions. Just as a recipe provides a list of ingredients and the instructions for preparing a dish the research design provides the components and the plan for successfully carrying out.</p>
