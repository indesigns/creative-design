<p>This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. Besides experimental designs not only involve the selection of suitable independent dependent and control variables but also planning the experiments under statistically optimal conditions. The position and size of the window depend on the questions being asked by and the quality of the experiment. Experimental design concerns the validity and efficiency of the experiment. Results are easy to interpret and lead to statistically justified conclusions.</p>
