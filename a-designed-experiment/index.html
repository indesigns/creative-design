<p><strong>A Designed Experiment</strong>, A designed experiment is a more effective way to deter-mine the impact of two or more factors on a response than a OFAT experiment where only one factor is changed at one time while the other factors are kept fixed because. A good experimental design requires a strong understanding of the system you are studying. A designed experiment is a series of runs or tests in which you purposefully make changes to input variables at the same time and observe the responses. In other words it is used to find cause-and-effect relationships.</p>

<p>Design of experiments DOE is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. Well-designed experiments can produce significantly more information and often require fewer runs than haphazard or unplanned experiments. It requires less resources experiments time material. If you expect that the response will be a nonlinear function of the factors at least 3 levels per factor must be used.
