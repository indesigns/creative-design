<p><strong>Bertone Designer</strong>, Marcello Gandinis design for Bertone is a fully-functioning one-off that still has the power to take your breath away today. Two years later a son was born to the Bertone household a son who would have a major impact on the world of automotive design. As Bertone was supplying bodies to Chrysler Simca in France for their rear-engined 1200 S Coupé the decision was taken between owner Nuccio Bertone and chief designer Marcello Gandini to develop a dune buggy on the base of the Simcas longitudinal rear. With Porsches approval he hired designer Nuccio Bertone to create a one-off 1966 Porsche 911 Spyder in hopes of launching low-volume production.</p>
