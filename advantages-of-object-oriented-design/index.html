<p><strong>Advantages Of Object Oriented Design</strong>, If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing things easily and eliminating the risks if any. We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily one object at a time. It is easy to maintain. Object-oriented design begins with an examination of the real world things.</p>
